# Realistic image generated by AI

## 📒 Description
This is a challenge proposed by my course, which consists of creating a realistic image using AI

## 🤖 Technologies used
Chat-GPT, Leonardo AI, MidJourney and a little photoshop

## 🧐 Creation process
I started with MidJourney, generating the most realistic image I could create, so i passed it on to Leonardo Ai so I could
refine some mistakes and make the image look even more realistic,passed for ChatGPT to refine more mistakes 
and finally, I used photoshop to try to make the image a little more realistic and remove some last errors, the image
was not perfect, but it satisfied me and I hope it satisfied you too.

## 🚀 Results
Results are in the file "Realistic image of two cats.jpg" 

## 💭 Reflection
The challenge was really very creative and intuitive, I had fun using AI's and seeing some strange results that were
generated, it also helped me put into practice the studies I did on AI prompts, great challenge 10/10
